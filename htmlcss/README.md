# HTML/CSS

I decided to stand this up on a basic express server to show redirect of node_modules to prevent exposure of modules in production.  Also, I have pulled in bootstrap with npm and imported it into `box.css`.  The colors should be identical, I have used a color picker to extract the hex color from the design itself.
#### To run:
1. `npm install`
2. `node server.js`
3. Open your favorite browser to `localhost:3000`.
