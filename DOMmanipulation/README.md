# DOM Manipulation

This file addresses questions 1, 2, and 3 in the DOM Manipulation section.  I elected to use a single function, run on `onkeyup` event to handle the textarea.  Each time the function runs I am checking the number of characters, running a ternary to decide whether I should change the color red=>black || black=>red, then updating the Max Chars.
